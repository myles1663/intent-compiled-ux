# Vision: The Generative UX App IDE

## What This Is

This project is a specialized IDE for building applications whose **interfaces are not predefined**, but are **compiled at runtime from user intent**.
Instead of designing screens, routes, and workflows up front, the applications generated by this IDE produce::
- interface structure
- data requirements
- interaction affordances

only after intent is expressed and context is known.

The UI is not authored.
It is assembled.

## Why Existing Tools Fail

Most modern tools assume:
- intent is known at the start
- workflows are stable
- AI belongs at the edge (copy, suggestions, chat)

Real work begins in uncertainty.

Users arrive without knowing:
- what they need
- what matters
- what the right structure is

Static interfaces force premature decisions.

This IDE waits.

## What Makes This an IDE (Not a Framework)

This system provides:
- a runtime composition engine
- explicit intent and confidence models
- deterministic rendering from generated plans
- inspectable artifacts at every step

You do not prompt UI.
You compile it.

## Core Principle

> The interface should do nothing until intent exists —  
> and only as much as intent requires.

## Who This Is For

- Systems engineers
- Compiler-minded developers
- Runtime / orchestration specialists
- UX designers working with adaptive systems
- Researchers focused on explainability and trust

## What We Are Building First

A minimal IDE capable of:
- capturing intent
- generating a composition plan
- rendering a working interface
- explaining why that interface exists

## How to Get Involved

Start with:
- `docs/ide/01-loop.md`
- `docs/ide/02-architecture.md`

Then propose primitives, failure cases, or instrumentation.
