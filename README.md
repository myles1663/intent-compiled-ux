# Generative UX Application Builder IDE

This repository contains a **specialized AI-assisted IDE** for building applications whose **front ends follow Generative UX architecture**.

The IDE itself is **not** generative UX.

It is a stable configuration and compile environment whose sole purpose is to:
- help builders define app structure, data, and rules
- compile those definitions into applications
- ensure that the **generated app** composes its interface at runtime from user intent

---

## What This IDE Builds

Applications generated by this IDE share a common runtime model:

- no predefined screens or flows
- interface composition occurs at runtime
- user intent and uncertainty are first-class state
- UI is assembled from constrained primitives
- the system can explain why interface elements exist
- behavior is deterministic given the same inputs

These behaviors exist **only in the generated application**, not in the IDE.

## Two Distinct Systems (Do Not Confuse These)

### 1. Configuration & Compile Loop (IDE)

This is how builders create and iterate apps:

**builder intent → app configuration → compile → run → feedback → safe edits**

The IDE:
- captures builder intent
- produces an explicit app blueprint
- compiles readable, inspectable code
- validates changes before applying them

See:
- [`docs/ide/03-builder-loop.md`](docs/ide/03-builder-loop.md)

---

### 2. Runtime Loop (Generated Application)

This is how the **generated application** behaves for end users:

**user intent → context → composition plan → deterministic render → instrumentation**

See:
- [`docs/ide/01-loop.md`](docs/ide/01-loop.md)

## IDE Documentation

Authoritative IDE documentation lives in `docs/ide`:

- `00-vision.md` – why this IDE exists
- `01-loop.md` – Generative UX runtime (generated apps)
- `02-architecture.md` – system boundaries
- `03-builder-loop.md` – configuration & compile loop
- `05-debug.md` – runtime failure modes and debugging

---

## Examples

`docs/examples` contains demonstrations and historical context.
These show **what the IDE can produce**, not how the IDE works.

---

## Status

Early, architectural, and intentionally constrained.

The focus is correctness, determinism, and explainability —
not novelty or interface experimentation.

If you want to build applications with Generative UX front ends,
start in [`docs/ide`](docs/ide).
